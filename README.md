## MusicLabz Spotify Application

This is a ReactJS Music database application. This wholly uses only the Spotify API. This project came about from an older project I've completed and wasn't really happy with the implementation (https://github.com/onethreeonefour/last-fm-db).

MusicLabz has search capabilities, playlists, artist and tracks all fetched from the Spotify API.

## Get It Running
You need to get your unique ID and secret from Spotify which can be seen in this link (https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login)

Set your .env variables and the npm install from root and everything should run correctly.
